  "description": "A Trial Account is simply an account on NEAR that has a set of pre-defined restrictions that limit the methods that it can call. This is achieved by deploying a very small no-std Rust smart contract on it (~25 kb or 0.25 $NEAR) that acts as a proxy, or middleman, for any outbound calls it makes.",
